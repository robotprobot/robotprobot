### Hello! Im Steven. ðŸ‘‹

Im from the UK and have been programming for many years.
First and foremost, I'm a tinkerer. I mess around with coding and create little (and some larger) projects when I think of them, but mainly I am a university student studying Computer Science (Cyber Security pathway).

I have created Discord bots, windows apps, console apps, etc.

My favourite language at the moment is JavaScript/NodeJS!

Thanks for viewing my profile, and have a look at my repositories! [Note; my main large projects that are ongoing (and university assignments) are in private repositories]
